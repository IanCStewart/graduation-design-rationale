# Reflectie
*My reflection about this project*

* What did I learn?
* What would i do different next time?
* Did I get what I wanted out of this project?
* What is my professional stance and where do I want to go next?
* Im collecting data; in sight of the new gdpr law what is my stance in this towards companies?
